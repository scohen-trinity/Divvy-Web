            <h2 class="hero-text-small-left">What is Divvy?</h2>
            <p class="body-text">Divvy is a mobile app that makes splitting the bill with other people easy. The app
                makes tracking and managing outstanding payments easy by taking care of calculating what is owed and
                keeping a ledger of outstanding payments within a group. The app allows users to keep a continuous
                running ledger detailing past and outstanding payments made in a group setting.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text"> When a member of a Divvy group covers the bill for everyone else, they make a request
                to the group with the amount of money they paid and details regarding who owes them back. After making a
                payment request, members who need to settle up can immediately pay their friend back, or wait until they
                cover the bill on a different occasion.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-card">
            <h2 class="hero-text-small-left">Does Divvy handle financial data?</h2>
            <p class="body-text">Divvy is not a payment app and does not handle financial data nor process financial
                transactions in any way. Instead, the app is a continuous running ledger to track expenses within
                groups. Should you wish to settle up with someone, you must do so via an external method and then track
                the payment in the app.
